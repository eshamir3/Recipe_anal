# Asssessment of Missingness
## NMAR Analysis 
I believe that one column that has a non-trivial missingness and could be NMAR is the review column. The review column corresponds to the written review for a review/rating for a single recipe by a user. The review column is NMAR because people are more likely to leave a written review for recipes that they feel strongly about --either strong positive feels or strong negative feelings. Therefore, reviews or sentiment that is relatively neutral or ambivalent will be missing from the review column, showing that the the review column is NMAR.
